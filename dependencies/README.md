The only reason I've added a README in this folder is because git doesn't allow you to have empty folders in repositories.

This folder is where you should put your dependencies such as GLFW, etc., on Windows. You shouldn't need this folder for Mac and Linux.

For complete setup information, look at the README in the [Homework 1 folder](../homework1/).
